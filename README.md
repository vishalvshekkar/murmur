# Murmur

**On-device voice-to-text and meeting transcription for Mac.**

Murmur is a native macOS app that transcribes your voice entirely on your Mac. No audio ever leaves your device when using local models. Dictate into any app, record and transcribe meetings offline, and optionally clean up text with AI.

## Features

### Private by Default

Your audio never leaves your Mac when using local models. Transcription happens entirely on-device using Apple's Neural Engine. No server, no upload, no internet required. You can optionally use cloud transcription with your own API keys — your data stays under your control.

### System-Wide Dictation

Press a keyboard shortcut, speak, and text appears at your cursor. Works in every app — Slack, Notion, VS Code, your browser, email drafts, anywhere. Choose from push-to-talk, toggle, or auto recording modes. Text is pasted directly into the active app or copied to your clipboard.

### Meetings & Notes

- **Offline meeting recording** — Record entire meetings locally with automatic chunked transcription
- **Speaker diarization** — Identify different speakers in your recordings
- **AI-powered summaries** — Generate key points and action items using local or cloud AI
- **Voice notes** — Capture quick thoughts with a separate hotkey
- **Searchable history** — Find any transcription with full-text search
- **Audio playback** — Listen back to any recording with synchronized transcript

### 30+ Transcription Models

Choose from over 30 model variants optimized for different needs:
- **Local models** — Multiple Whisper variants, NVIDIA Parakeet, Apple Speech
- **Cloud models** — OpenAI transcription with your own API key
- **Benchmark data** — Every model shows real speed and accuracy metrics
- **Download only what you need** — Models range from 75MB to 3GB

### 99 Languages

Automatic language detection with support for 99 languages. Switch languages mid-sentence without changing settings, or lock to a specific language.

### Streaming Transcription

See your words appear in real-time as you speak. No waiting for processing — text flows naturally as you talk.

### Optional AI Cleanup

Turn on AI refinement to automatically:
- Fix punctuation and grammar
- Strip filler words (um, uh, like)
- Adjust tone based on context

Context-aware: preserves technical terms in code editors, cleans up prose in emails. Works with local AI via Ollama or cloud providers like OpenAI. Off by default.

### Context Awareness

The Direct Download version detects what app you're using:
- **Browser context** — Knows what website you're on
- **Editor context** — Detects your project and file type
- **Smart refinement** — AI adjusts its output based on context

### Statistics Dashboard

Track your voice productivity:
- Time saved vs typing
- Words dictated
- Usage patterns
